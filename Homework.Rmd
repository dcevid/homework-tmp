```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data

We first generate the data:

```{r}
data = rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog=0.25)
```

Its mean is `r mean(data)` and its variance is `r sd(data)^2`.


## Visualization

We plot here the histograms, by using ggplot since its nicer than base R.

* without transformation

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data)
```

* log scale

```{r}
qplot(log(data))
```
